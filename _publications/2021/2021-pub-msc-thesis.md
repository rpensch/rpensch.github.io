  The non-coding space makes up around 98 % of the genome, but cancer-driving mutations have so far mostly been discovered in protein-coding regions. The majority of somatic non-coding mutations are neutral passenger mutations and identifying non-coding mutations with driving roles in cancer poses a challenge. In this work, evolutionary constraint was used to explore the non-coding space in human osteosarcoma to improve our understanding of how evolutionary constraint can be applied to identify non-coding driver mutations in cancer and describe the unknown role of non-coding mutations in osteosarcoma.
