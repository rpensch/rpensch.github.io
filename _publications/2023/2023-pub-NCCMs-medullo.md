  Identification of cancer driver genes is important for understanding the biology of cancer and to define treatment targets. So far, protein-coding mutations have been frequently studied but less is known about regulatory noncoding mutation. Here, we identify noncoding constraint mutations (NCCMs) that are strong predictors of novel candidate cancer driver genes, defined primarily by regulatory changes. We find NCCMs in different genes in children and adult patients. This may lead to better stratification of medulloblastoma by age and subgroup and may improve targeted treatment strategies.
