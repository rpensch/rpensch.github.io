  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive hematopoietic neoplasm that affects humans as well as dogs. While previous studies on canine DLBCL (cDLBCL) have significantly advanced our understanding of the disease, the majority of this research has relied on whole-exome sequencing, which is limited in its ability to detect copy number aberrations and other genomic changes beyond coding regions. Furthermore, many of these studies lack sufficient clinical follow-up data, making it difficult to draw meaningful associations between genetic variants and patient outcomes. Our study aimed to characterize the mutational landscape of cDLBCL using whole-genome sequencing of matched tumor-normal samples obtained from a cohort of 43 dogs previously enrolled in a clinical trial for which longitudinal follow-up was available. We focused on identifying genes that were significantly or recurrently mutated with coding point mutations, copy number aberrations, and their associations with patient outcomes.
